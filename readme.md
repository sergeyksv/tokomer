Project is desigend to be buildable by both StmCubeIDE and platformio. First was used to edit hardware mapping and optionally debug code and latest is used to make development quicker. In order to make project work in platformio it is required to substitute stm32cube.py in ./platformio/platcorms/ststm32/builder/frameworks with one that can be found below. This is beacuse platformio has very old stm32cube binding, doesn't understand CubeIDE tree strcuture etc
